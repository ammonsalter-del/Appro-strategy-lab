## About

Appropriation Strategy Lab is a browser-based educational game designed for business school students and anyone interested in innovation strategy. Players are presented with different products and services and must choose the best combination of protection mechanisms to help firms capture value from their innovations.

The game is based on David Teece's influential framework from "Profiting from Technological Innovation" (1986), which explores why innovating firms often fail to capture the economic returns from their innovations.
