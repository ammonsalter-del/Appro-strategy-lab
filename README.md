## About

Appropriation Strategy Lab is a browser-based educational game designed for business school students and anyone interested in innovation strategy. Players are presented with different products and services and must choose the best combination of protection mechanisms to help firms capture value from their innovations.

The game is based on David Teece's influential framework from "Profiting from Technological Innovation" (1986), which explores why innovating firms often fail to capture the economic returns from their innovations.

### Key Concepts Covered

- **Formal Protection Mechanisms**
  - Patents
  - Trade Marks
  - Copyright

- **Informal/Practical Methods**
  - Secrecy (trade secrets)
  - Lead Time & First-Mover Advantage
  - Complexity & Tacit Skill
  - Community & Switching Costs

- **Complementary Assets & Contracts**
  - Manufacturing, distribution, sales capabilities
  - NDAs, exclusivity agreements, licensing terms

## Features

- **30 diverse scenarios** covering pharmaceuticals, software, food & beverage, fashion, biotech, and more
- **10 scenarios per playthrough** randomly selected for high replayability
- **Randomised answer order** — response options appear in a different order each time, preventing pattern recognition
- **Balanced response design** — all answer options have similar lengths, so players must evaluate content rather than guess based on format
- **Immediate feedback** with detailed explanations for each choice
- **Progress tracking** with profit scores and accuracy metrics
- **Ranking system** from Butterfly 🦋 to Dragon 🐲
- **Bonus Mini-Game: "Value Drop"** — a fast-paced game where products fall toward value buckets and players must quickly attach the right protection mechanisms to steer them toward high value capture
- **Supportive end-of-game summary** with personalised feedback and learning suggestions

## What's New (June 2025)

### Gameplay Improvements
- **Randomised response options**: All 30 scenarios now display their three answer choices in random order each time, eliminating any positional bias
- **Equalised answer lengths**: Response labels have been standardised to similar character counts (57-74 characters), removing the previous pattern where correct answers tended to be longer
- **Mini-game introduction**: The intro screen now explains the "Value Drop" bonus round so players know what to expect
